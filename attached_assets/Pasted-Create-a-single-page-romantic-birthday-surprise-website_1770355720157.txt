Create a single-page romantic birthday surprise website for my girlfriend. The website must look premium, emotional, and fully decorated with birthday + love theme. It must be mobile responsive.

Theme & Design

Colors: soft pink, red, white, gold accents

Background: animated gradient + floating hearts + balloons + sparkles + confetti

Smooth scroll animations

Cute and romantic vibe

One page only

Sections (One Page)
1) Hero Section (Top)

Big title: “Happy Birthday My Love ❤️”

Subtitle: “You are the most special person in my life”

A cute animated heart + balloons

A big button: “Play Our Song 🎶”

When the button is clicked, smoothly scroll to the music section

2) Music Section (IMPORTANT)

Add “Main Tera – Arijit Singh” as the song using a YouTube embedded player (because browsers block autoplay and copyrighted MP3 files should not be hosted).

Title: “🎶 Our Song: Main Tera”

Short text: “Play this song and read the letter 💖”

Add a responsive YouTube iframe embed

Make it look like a beautiful music card with rounded corners and soft shadow

Use this embed format (use any working YouTube video of the song):

https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID

Make sure the iframe is 100% width on mobile.

3) Photo Gallery Section

Beautiful photo grid (3–12 images)

Rounded corners + shadow + hover zoom

Use placeholder image paths so I can replace later:

/images/pic1.jpg

/images/pic2.jpg

/images/pic3.jpg

etc.

4) Love Letter Section

A fancy card with a romantic handwritten-style font

Title: “A Letter For You 💌”

Write a long emotional birthday love letter

Include sweet lines, gratitude, and romantic promises

Add typing animation OR fade-in line by line

5) Birthday Countdown + Surprise

Add a countdown timer (editable date in script.js)

When countdown ends:

Show: “🎉 SURPRISE! I LOVE YOU FOREVER ❤️”

Trigger a confetti burst animation

6) Final Romantic Ending

Big text: “You are my favorite person forever 💖”

Glowing heart animation

Button: “Click for a Final Kiss 😘”

On click show popup: “Mwahhh 😘 Happy Birthday, my love!”

Technical Requirements (Very Important)

Use only HTML + CSS + JavaScript (no backend)

Make it one page only

File structure must be:

index.html

style.css

script.js

images/

Add clear comments in code where I can change:

girlfriend name

birthday date

photos

YouTube video link

Must run perfectly on Replit instantly

Add smooth animations, soft shadows, modern UI

Use only free fonts from Google Fonts

Make the final website extremely beautiful, romantic, and birthday-surprise themed.
